## Latest: BB-001 Benchbook Initial Repository and Full Workflow Slice (2026-09-12)

TASK_ID: BB-001
STATUS: READY_FOR_REVIEW
WORKER: AGY, senior full-stack developer
MODEL: Gemini 3.8 Flash High
EFFORT: HIGH
BRANCH: worker/agy/BB-001
BASE_COMMIT: 78830b8
PROPOSED_COMMIT_MSG: feat(benchbook): complete initial repository and live workflow slice (BB-001)

Created and verified the complete independent repository for Project 2 (Benchbook) at:
`D:\Work\Codex\Hackathon Projects\Agents For Humans\02_BENCHBOOK`

Key achievements & verifications:
- Product & Context:
  - Benchbook keeps a repair shop moving from intake to pickup without making the technician become a full-time coordinator.
  - Realistic Tamil Nadu repair shop context (Kovai Tech Bench, Gandhipuram, Coimbatore) with contact-safe synthetic presets (Atomberg BLDC Fan, Voltas AC Inverter PCB, Preethi Mixer Grinder, ThinkPad Laptop).
- Complete Live 11-Stage Workflow Slice (Persisted in SQLite with WAL & FK constraints):
  `intake -> technician note -> parts lookup -> estimate -> customer approval -> supplier status -> repair queue -> repair in progress -> completion -> pickup notification -> follow-up -> close`
- Strict Human Approval Gates:
  - Customer approval of estimate, technician QC completion sign-off, and job close strictly require human authorization.
  - Assistant or system calls return HTTP 403 HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED.
- Optimistic Concurrency & Idempotency:
  - Version increment on every mutation; stale writes return HTTP 409 STATE_CONFLICT.
  - Idempotency-Key caching returns identical payload without duplicate mutation or version increment.
  - Immutable audit event trail recorded for every transition.
- Advisory Assistant Adapter:
  - Deterministic offline rules with explicit provenance (engine, model, timestamp, advisory_only: true).
  - Testable honest failure modes: timeout (504), busy (429), unavailable (503), invalid_output (502).
  - Bounded Strands integration seam (zero live network calls, ₹0.00 spend).
- Frontend Workbench (apps/web):
  - React 18 + Vite SPA with English-first accessible UI.
  - Visual 11-stage WorkflowTimeline, left bench job list, active step action form, and real-time audit stream.
  - 100% refresh-proof: loads state from API on load and refresh.
- Automated Verification:
  - Backend pytest: 25 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed in 0.94s.
  - Frontend vitest: 7 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed in 204ms.
  - Ruff check & format: clean (26 source files).
  - Mypy: clean (strict mode, 26 source files).
  - Frontend tsc typecheck & eslint: clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
  - Frontend build: clean production bundle generated in 550ms.
- Personal spend: Exactly ₹0.00.
